# Project 2: FLIGHT DELAYS & CANCELLATIONS

**Team:** Wei Zhu, Irene Okada, Adam Katz, Desiree Diaz

---

**Our goal is to develop an interactive website that allows web-users to easily navigate the website and gather the information they are seeking while remaining engaged with the site.**

**We decided to review flight delays and cancellations from various airlines and airports in the United States. Although there is a lot of data containing flight delays and cancellations, we sourced the data from Kaggle.com and analyzed it for January 1, 2018.**

**We developed a website using various tools containing general information on flight delays and cancellations. The website includes:**

- General Information about Flight Delays & Cancellations
- A dashboard that will allow the user to gather information on flight delay and cancellation for a specific airlines and airports
- Map displaying the cities with airports with flight delays information
- A chart containing flight information
- Links to airline and airport news' websites
